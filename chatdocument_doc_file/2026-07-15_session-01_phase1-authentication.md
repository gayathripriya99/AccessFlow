# Session 01 — 2026-07-15 → 2026-07-16

**Scope of this session:** Kicked off AccessFlow from an empty repo (only `doc_files/00_AI_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS_AccessFlow.md` existed) and completed **Phase 1: Authentication** (backend only), plus repo/documentation scaffolding.

> How to use this file: if you say "refer that chat and continue from where you stopped," this is the file to re-read. It records what was decided, what was built, what was verified, and exactly what's left. The "Where things stand / next steps" section at the bottom is the fastest way back in.

---

## 1. Request → Plan (chronological)

1. User pointed at `doc_files/00_AI_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS_AccessFlow.md` and asked to start the project "in a structured and responsive and robust way."
2. Read the master instructions doc in full. Key constraints noted: phased build (never generate the whole project at once), backend must stay frontend-agnostic, clean architecture (`Controller → Service → Repository → MongoDB`), permission-based RBAC (never check `role == "Admin"` directly), and an end-of-phase `Phase-XX.md` summary requirement.
3. Entered plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) given the scale of the ask.
4. Attempted to ask 4 clarifying questions (backend language, Phase 1 scope, MongoDB setup, git init) via `AskUserQuestion` — **user rejected this**, signaling "just proceed, stop asking."
5. Also attempted a `/init`-style CLAUDE.md write mid-planning — **user also rejected this** (wrong moment; plan wasn't approved yet) and re-sent the original request.
6. Wrote a concrete plan directly to the plan file (no further questions), using sensible defaults justified by the doc itself:
   - **TypeScript** for backend (doc demands production-grade/maintainable code).
   - **Phase 1 = backend-only.** Justified directly from the doc's own phase ordering: Phase 1 Authentication → Phase 2 CRUD → Phase 3 Authorization Middleware → Phase 4 **Protected UI** — frontend clearly starts at Phase 4.
   - **MongoDB via `MONGO_URI` env var**, defaulting to local.
   - **Git initialized** at repo root, standard Node `.gitignore`.
   - **npm** + **Jest/Supertest** for testing.
7. Called `ExitPlanMode` — **user approved the plan as written**, no changes requested.

Plan file (if it still exists on disk): `C:\Users\HP\.claude\plans\lucky-toasting-willow.md`. Full text of the approved plan is reproduced in section 3 below so this doc is self-contained even if that file is gone.

## 2. What was actually built

### Repo root (`e:\RBAC_Project\`)
- `git init` run at repo root (no commits made yet — user hasn't asked for a commit).
- `.gitignore` (node_modules, dist/build, .env*, logs, coverage, OS/IDE cruft).
- `README.md` — project overview, repo layout, phase-status table (Phase 1 marked **Complete**).
- `CLAUDE.md` — guidance file for future Claude Code sessions (written in a later part of this same session, after Phase 1 code was verified — see section 4).

### `backend/` — full Node/Express/TypeScript/Mongoose scaffold

**Config & tooling**
- `package.json` (scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `test`, `test:watch`)
- `tsconfig.json` (strict mode, ES2022, noUnusedLocals/Parameters, etc.)
- `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` (committed) and `.env` (gitignored, real dev values filled in so `npm run dev`/tests work locally)

**`src/config/`**
- `env.ts` — typed env loader; throws at import time if a required var is missing.
- `logger.ts` — pino, pretty-printed in development.
- `database.ts` — `connectDatabase(uri?)` / `disconnectDatabase()`.

**`src/models/`** (Mongoose schemas)
- `User.ts` — email (unique), passwordHash (`select: false`), name, isActive, `roles: ObjectId[]` (reserved, unused until Phase 2).
- `RefreshToken.ts` — userId, tokenHash, expiresAt (**TTL-indexed**, Mongo auto-purges expired docs), revokedAt, replacedByToken.
- `AuditLog.ts` — userId, action (enum of auth events), ip, userAgent, metadata, createdAt only.

**`src/repositories/`**
- `UserRepository.ts`, `RefreshTokenRepository.ts`, `AuditLogRepository.ts` — pure data access, no business logic.

**`src/services/`**
- `AuthService.ts` — the business-logic core:
  - `register` — duplicate-email check, bcrypt hash (12 rounds), creates user, audit-logs `auth.register`.
  - `login` — verifies credentials (generic "Invalid email or password" on any failure to avoid user enumeration), audit-logs success/failure, issues token pair.
  - `refresh` — verifies the presented refresh JWT, looks up the stored hash by `jti`, **rotates** it (revokes old, issues new), and on **reuse detection** (an already-revoked token presented again) revokes *every* active refresh token for that user and audit-logs `auth.refresh.reuse_detected`.
  - `logout` — revokes the refresh token, idempotent even if the token is already invalid/missing.
  - `getCurrentUser` — backs the `/me` endpoint.
  - Private `issueTokenPair` — the trickiest bit: pre-generates the new `RefreshToken` document's `_id` *before* signing the JWT, so the JWT's `jti` claim and the stored document's `_id` always match (this was a real bug caught and fixed during implementation — see section 5).

**`src/validators/`**
- `auth.validators.ts` — Zod schemas for register (password needs 8+ chars, upper/lower/digit) and login.

**`src/middlewares/`**
- `validateRequest.ts` (Zod → 400 with field errors)
- `errorHandler.ts` + `notFoundHandler` (centralized `ApiError` → consistent JSON error shape)
- `rateLimiter.ts` (`express-rate-limit`, configurable via env, applied to `/register`/`/login`/`/refresh`)
- `requireAuth.ts` (verifies bearer access JWT, populates `req.auth` — **authentication only, not authorization/permission-checking**, which is explicitly Phase 3's job)

**`src/controllers/AuthController.ts`** — thin HTTP layer: `register`, `login`, `refresh`, `logout`, `me`.

**`src/routes/v1/`** — `auth.routes.ts` (composition root wiring repo→service→controller instances), `health.routes.ts`, `index.ts`.

**`src/app.ts` / `src/server.ts`** — Helmet, CORS (env allowlist), cookie-parser, morgan/pino request logging, mounts `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/*`, graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

**`src/utils/`** — `ApiError.ts`, `asyncHandler.ts`, `jwt.ts` (sign/verify access + refresh, `getTokenExpiry`), `hashToken.ts` (SHA-256 for refresh tokens — deliberately not bcrypt, since refresh tokens are already high-entropy, unlike passwords), `cookies.ts` (httpOnly refresh cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth`).

**`tests/`**
- `env.setup.ts` (Jest `setupFiles` — env vars present before any module import)
- `setup.ts` (Jest `setupFilesAfterEnv` — spins up `mongodb-memory-server`, connects, clears collections after each test, tears down after all)
- `auth.test.ts` — 9 integration tests: register (success/duplicate/weak-password), login (wrong-password/success), `/me` (no-token/valid-token), refresh (rotation + reuse-rejection), logout (revokes + blocks subsequent refresh).

### API surface delivered (`/api/v1`)
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Returns public user only, no tokens |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Returns `{ user, accessToken }`, sets httpOnly refresh cookie |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | Rotates refresh token; reuse of an old one revokes the whole session |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Revokes refresh token, clears cookie, idempotent |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Bearer-authenticated, returns current user |
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |

## 3. Full approved plan (verbatim, for reference)

The plan below is exactly what was approved via `ExitPlanMode` before implementation started.

> # AccessFlow — Phase 1: Authentication (Backend)
>
> ## Context
> `e:\RBAC_Project` is the AccessFlow repo root — it currently contains only `doc_files/00_AI_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS_AccessFlow.md`, the master spec. Per that spec's mandated phased workflow (never build the whole project at once), Phase 1 is **Authentication**. The doc's own phase ordering (Phase 1 Authentication → Phase 2 CRUD → Phase 3 Authorization Middleware → Phase 4 **Protected UI**) makes clear that Phases 1–3 are backend-only; frontend work starts at Phase 4. So this plan scaffolds `backend/` only — no frontend folders yet, keeping the repo lean until each phase actually needs them.
>
> Defaults chosen: TypeScript backend, MongoDB via `MONGO_URI` env var (local default), Git initialized at repo root, npm + Jest/Supertest.
>
> ## Target structure, clean architecture flow, feature scope, verification plan, explicitly-deferred list
>
> (See `backend/README.md` and `backend/Phase-01.md` — they document the as-built version of this same plan in full, including the exact endpoint list, model fields, cross-cutting requirements, and verification steps. The as-built docs superseded this plan text once implementation was complete and are the more accurate reference going forward.)

---

## 4. Post-implementation additions (this same session, after Phase 1 code was done)

After Phase 1 was built and verified, the user asked to:
1. Read `doc_files/12_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER_GUIDE.md` (GitHub account/repo/deployment conventions — **not yet acted on**, see section 6).
2. Run `/init` to (re-)create `CLAUDE.md` — done, now reflects the real codebase (commands, architecture, RBAC rules, non-obvious auth/session design notes, and a pointer to the deployment guide's rules).
3. Archive this session's work into a new `chatdocument_doc_file/` folder so a future chat can say "refer that chat" and resume — this file is that archive.

---

## 5. Notable decisions, bugs caught, and reasoning worth preserving

- **Register vs. login are separate** — register does not auto-issue tokens; client must call `/login` next. Keeps the two concerns cleanly separated and matches the doc's endpoint framing.
- **Generic "Invalid email or password"** on any login failure (bad email, bad password, inactive user) — avoids user-enumeration.
- **Refresh token = JWT + server-side hash**, not a bare opaque token and not a bare JWT. Reasoning: a bare JWT alone can't be revoked before its natural expiry; a bare opaque token can't be self-verified. Combining both (JWT for stateless verification, hash lookup by `jti` for revocation/rotation) gets both properties.
- **Bug caught during implementation:** initially, `AuthService.issueTokenPair` generated a new `RefreshToken` document via `.create()` *without* pinning its `_id`, but had already signed the refresh JWT with a separately pre-generated `jti`. That meant the JWT's `jti` would never match the actual stored document's `_id`, silently breaking every refresh. Fixed by adding an optional `_id` field to `RefreshTokenRepository.CreateRefreshTokenInput` and having the service pass the pre-generated `ObjectId` through explicitly. This was caught by re-reading the code before running tests, not by test failure — worth double-checking similar "generate ID before signing, use it after" patterns in future phases.
- **Reuse detection revokes the whole user session**, not just the replayed token — simpler and safer than trying to track/revoke just one token "family," at the cost of logging the user out of all devices on a detected replay. Explicit tradeoff, not an oversight.
- **SHA-256 (not bcrypt) for refresh-token-at-rest hashing** — bcrypt's deliberate slowness is for defending low-entropy secrets (passwords) against brute force; refresh tokens are already high-entropy signed JWTs, so a fast cryptographic hash is the right tool and avoids needless latency on every refresh call.

---

## 6. Verification performed (don't re-derive — trust this, or re-run if code has changed since)

1. `npm run build` — clean (strict TypeScript).
2. `npm run lint` — clean (ESLint, `@typescript-eslint`).
3. `npm test` — **9/9 passing**, Jest + Supertest against `mongodb-memory-server` (register success/duplicate/weak-password, login wrong-password/success, `/me` no-token/valid-token, refresh rotation + reuse-rejection, logout + post-logout refresh rejection).
4. **Live smoke test** (beyond the test suite): booted the real `createApp()` HTTP server against a standalone in-memory MongoDB instance and drove it with real `curl` requests — confirmed security headers (Helmet), rate-limit headers, the full register → login → `/me` → refresh (cookie rotation) → logout → refresh-after-logout-rejected flow, all working outside of the Jest/supertest in-process harness. Temp smoke script and log files were deleted afterward; nothing from that smoke test remains in the repo.

No local `mongod` binary is available in this environment — `npm run dev` against a real local MongoDB has **not** been manually verified; only the in-memory-Mongo smoke test above. If a real local/Atlas MongoDB becomes available, worth a quick real `npm run dev` sanity check before relying on it.

## 7. Where things stand / next steps

**Done:** Phase 1 (Authentication) — backend only, fully built, tested, and documented (`backend/README.md`, `backend/Phase-01.md`). Root `README.md` phase table updated to mark Phase 1 complete. `CLAUDE.md` written for future-session guidance.

**Explicitly not done yet (by design, per the master doc's phase ordering):**
- Phase 2 — Roles & Permissions collections, Users/Roles/Permissions CRUD APIs, wiring up the already-reserved `User.roles` field.
- Phase 3 — Authorization middleware that resolves permissions from roles (never `role === "Admin"` checks) and guards routes.
- Phase 4 — First protected frontend client. No `frontend-*` folders exist yet — intentionally deferred.
- Phase 5 — Audit Log *query/viewing* API and UI (the write path already exists from Phase 1).
- Phases 6–8 — Permission Simulator, Advanced RBAC, ABAC + multi-tenant.
- i18n, responsive breakpoints, and other cross-cutting frontend requirements — apply starting Phase 4.

**Also pending, from the GitHub deployment guide the user asked to be read this session (`doc_files/12_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_MASTER_GUIDE.md`) — nothing here has been acted on yet:**
- No GitHub repo created, no commits made (git is `init`'d locally only, working tree is unstaged/uncommitted).
- No dedicated Git identity/SSH key/`~/.ssh/config` host set up for the `gayathripriyacvg@gmail.com` GitHub account the guide specifies.
- No Vercel/Render/MongoDB Atlas deployment configured.
- No GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- Per the guide's own AI-instructions section: any of the above that touches the user's accounts/local machine/credentials requires explicit confirmation before acting, and secrets/keys must never be requested or stored by the assistant.

**Fastest way to resume:** tell the next session to read this file, then `backend/Phase-01.md` and `backend/README.md` for the as-built specifics, then proceed with whichever phase (2, or the GitHub/deployment work) is next.
